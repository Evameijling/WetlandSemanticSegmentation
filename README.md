# WetlandSemanticSegmentation
This repository contains the code for my thesis on semantic segmentation of wetland vegetation using U-Net and self-supervised learning. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation with Sentinel-2 and VHR imagery, aiming to improve classification performance while reducing reliance on labeled data.
