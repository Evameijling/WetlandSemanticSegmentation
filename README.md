# AI-Driven Segmentation and Classification of Vegetation in the Biesbosch Floodplain Using Remote Sensing Data

This repository contains the code and methodology from my thesis research on **semantic segmentation for wetland vegetation classification**. The study explores **self-supervised learning (SSL) and deep learning architectures, such as U-Net**, to classify vegetation roughness using **Sentinel-2 and Very High-Resolution (VHR) Pléiades NEO imagery**. The goal is to enhance classification accuracy while **reducing reliance on annotated data**.  

## 📌 Overview  
The research focuses on:  
- 🌍 **Remote sensing for wetland monitoring**, particularly in the Biesbosch area.  
- 🧠 **Deep learning-based land cover classification** using U-Net, trained with and without SSL pretraining.  
- 🔍 **Impact of image resolution on classification performance**.  
- ⚙️ **Automated data preprocessing and segmentation pipeline** for high-resolution satellite imagery.  

## 📂 Code Structure  
This repository is a **restructured version** of my original research code, reorganized for clarity. As a result, some **file paths and references may not match exactly**. However, with minor adjustments, all scripts remain fully functional on any system.  

## 🛠 Installation & Usage  
To run the scripts, first install all dependencies using:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
